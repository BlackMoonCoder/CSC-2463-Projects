# 🚀 Arduino-Powered Space Shooter Game

Welcome to the **Arduino + p5.js + Tone.js Space Shooter** — a browser game where you blast asteroids out of the sky using a *real joystick and button*. It’s old-school arcade meets DIY hardware!

---

## 🎯 What’s This?

This is a fun project that combines:

- 🎮 A joystick and button connected to an **Arduino Uno**
- 🖱️ A spaceship you control in the browser with smooth movement
- 💥 Asteroids that need destroying
- 🔊 Sound effects and music using **Tone.js**
- 💡 LED lighting up every time you shoot (pew pew!)

You control the ship with physical movement. It’s like bringing your game controller to life!

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- The **joystick** sends X and Y movement data from the Arduino.
- A **button press** fires a laser (and lights up the LED).
- **p5.js** draws everything: spaceship, asteroids, lasers.
- **Tone.js** handles music and sound effects.
- Enemies spawn and move across the screen — shoot them before they hit you!
